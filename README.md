# Patient-Monitoring-System

The project's main focus is to use the time spent on manual registration effectively by updating the information of the patients on this web app. It uses timestamps to keep a record of the patient's treatment duration. It also shows the information about the test including the time. Registering manually will take more time due to which the testing time may differ from the actual time. This application simplifies data entry, reducing patient wait time and making it easier for doctors to keep track of patient information.
